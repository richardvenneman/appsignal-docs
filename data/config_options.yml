        The environment of the app to be reported to AppSignal. This config option will be automatically detected in Rails apps. For Rails apps the `RAILS_ENV` variable is used to detect the environment. For apps using other frameworks or none at all, the `RACK_ENV` environment variable is used.

        To override the automatic detecting, use the `APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV` environment variable.

        ```sh
        export APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV=staging
        rackup
        ```

        This option will be used to load the configuration from the [config files](index.html) in which the AppSignal configuration is stored.

        The environment variable option is commonly used on platforms where apps run in the `production` environment by default, such as Heroku. This setting allows an override to set the environment to `staging`, for example.

        ```sh
        heroku config:set APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV=staging
        ```

        -> **Note**: Changing the [name](#option-name) or environment of an existing app will create a new app on AppSignal.com.

        -> **Note**: This config option has no config file key equivalent. To set the environment on AppSignal initialization, you'll need to [initialize the configuration manually](/ruby/instrumentation/integrating-appsignal.html#configuration-file).

        ####^option-appsignal_app_env Custom environments in config file

        There is no `env` key available in the `config/appsignal.yml` file. If you wish to dynamically set the environment name for an app in the config file it's possible to customize your config file to use the environment to create an environment.

        ```yml
        # config/appsignal.yml
        <%= ENV["APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV"] %>:
          active: true
        ```

        If you use another environment variable than `APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV` make sure that matches the value is any of the auto detected environment variable names (`RAILS_ENV` and `RACK_ENV`) or the value given to [`Appsignal::Config.new`](/ruby/instrumentation/integrating-appsignal.html#configuration-file).

        The environment of the app to be reported to AppSignal. This option is set by default by our installer, to `Mix.env`. To override it, change the value in `config/appsignal.exs` (or your config file of choice).

        ```elixir
        # config/appsignal.exs
        # or config/config.exs
        config :appsignal, :config,
          env: Mix.env # Installer default

        # Set your own value
        config :appsignal, :config,
          env: :staging
        ```


        To override the config option in the system environment, use the `APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV` environment variable.

        ```sh
        # The method of setting environment variables may differ on your system
        export APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV=staging
        mix run
        ```

        The environment variable option is commonly used on platforms, such as Heroku, where apps run in the `production` environment by default. This setting allows an override to set the environment to `staging`, for example.

        ```sh
        heroku config:set APPSIGNAL_APP_ENV=staging

        The `request_headers` config option contains a list of HTTP request headers which are read and stored by the AppSignal Ruby gem.

        This `request_headers` config option is an *allowlist*, which means that it will only take headers as specified by this config option. If this config option is unset it will use the AppSignal default.

        Following list is the AppSignal gem default.

        ```yml
        # config/appsignal.yml
        default: &defaults
          request_headers:
            - HTTP_ACCEPT
            - HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET
            - HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING
            - HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
            - HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL
            - HTTP_CONNECTION
            - CONTENT_LENGTH
            - PATH_INFO
            - HTTP_RANGE
            - REQUEST_METHOD
            - REQUEST_URI
            - SERVER_NAME
            - SERVER_PORT
            - SERVER_PROTOCOL
        ```

        Note that AppSignal reads the headers from your app and they may not match 1 to 1 with what is being sent in the browser/client. In [Rack apps](https://rack.github.io/) ([Rails](/ruby/integrations/rails.html), [Sinatra](/ruby/integrations/sinatra.html), etc) all custom headers are prefixed with the `HTTP_` string, all header names are uppercased and dashes (`-`) are replaced with underscores (`_`).

        For example, the `X-Hub-Signature` header can be access by your app and AppSignal with the `HTTP_X_HUB_SIGNATURE` name.

        To configure AppSignal to not store any HTTP request headers on AppSignal transactions, configure the option with an empty array.

        ```yml
        # config/appsignal.yml
        default: &defaults
          request_headers: []
        ```

      AppSignal expects to be running on the same machine between different deploys. Set this key to `true` if you use a container based deployment system such as Docker.

      Newer versions of the AppSignal integration automatically detect its container environment, so no manual configuration is necessary. If you're having trouble with the automatic detection, please [contact support](mailto:support@appsignal.com).

      This option is set to `true` automatically on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/).

      Set the app revision for the currently running version of your app. Used to create deploy markers and tag all incoming data to a certain deploy for the host.

      When using Heroku with the [Heroku Labs: Dyno Metadata](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) enabled it will automatically set the `revision` config option to to the `HEROKU_SLUG_COMMIT` system environment variable. This will automatically report new deploys when the Heroku app gets deployed. The revision can still be overwritten by setting the `revision` config option yourself.

      Read more about deploy markers on the [deploy markers](/application/markers/deploy-markers.html).
