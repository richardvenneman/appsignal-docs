[Grape](http://www.ruby-grape.org/) support is integrated in AppSignal Ruby gem
versions `1.1` and up.

For older versions of the AppSignal Ruby gem, check [grape-appsignal
gem](https://github.com/aai/grape-appsignal) created by [Mark
Madsen](https://github.com/idyll).

## Installation

A Grape application requires a few manual steps to get working.

1. Create a `config/appsignal.yml` configuration file or configure it with
   environment variables. For more information see
   the [Ruby configuration](/ruby/configuration.html) page.
*  Make sure AppSignal is required, `require "appsignal"`.
*  Require the Grape integration, `require "appsignal/integrations/grape"`.
*  Start AppSignal, `Appsignal.start`.

A Grape `config.ru` file looks something like this:

```ruby
# config.ru
require File.expand_path("../config/environment", __FILE__)
require_relative "./api.rb"

Appsignal.config = Appsignal::Config.new(
  File.expand_path("../", __FILE__), # The root of your app
  ENV["RACK_ENV"] # The environment of your app (development/production)
)

Appsignal.start_logger
Appsignal.start

run Acme::App
```

An example of a Grape `api.rb` file:

```ruby
# api.rb
# require these two files
require "appsignal"
require "appsignal/integrations/grape"

module Acme
  class API < Grape::API
    insert_before Grape::Middleware::Error, Appsignal::Grape::Middleware # Include this middleware

    prefix "api"
    format :json
    get "/" do
      { :message => "Hello world!" }
    end
  end
end
```

`insert_before` was introduced in Grape 0.19. If you use an earlier
version use this approach:

```ruby
use Appsignal::Grape::Middleware
```

After these steps, start your Grape application and wait for data to arrive in
AppSignal.

## Grape on Rails

Grape is often used in combination with Ruby on Rails as a mounted application.
To make sure performance and error metrics from both Grape and Rails are captured we recommend the following configuration:

1. [Install AppSignal for Rails](/ruby/integrations/rails.html) as described in the documentation.
2. Add the `Appsignal::Grape::Middleware` to each grape-root file for every API, for example `app/controllers/api/v1/root.rb`.

```ruby
# root.rb
require "appsignal/integrations/grape"

module Acme
  class API < Grape::API
    use Appsignal::Grape::Middleware # Include this middleware

    prefix "api"
    format :json
    get "/" do
      { :message => "Hello world!" }
    end
  end
end
```

## Ignoring errors

-> **Note**: Ignoring errors from Grape apps this way is supported since AppSignal Ruby gem version 2.10.5.

To ignore a specific Grape error set the `grape.skip_appsignal_error` flag in the request environment. This will tell AppSignal to ignore the error that occurs during the request. This allows you to stop reporting of errors to AppSignal.

Only ignore errors like this if you need to ignore errors from a Grape app using code. See the [`ignore_errors` option](/ruby/configuration/ignore-errors.html) to ignore it for the entire app. If you don't want to be notified about an error, see [our notification settings](/application/notification-settings.html).

```ruby
get "/" do
  env["grape.skip_appsignal_error"] = true # Add this line to an endpoint or callback
  raise "uh oh" # Example error, don't copy this
end
```

Note that if an error is rescued in the app itself using `rescue_from` AppSignal will not receive and track the error. The error will need to be manually set on the AppSignal transaction.

```ruby
class Api < ::Grape::API
  insert_before Grape::Middleware::Error, Appsignal::Grape::Middleware

  format :json

  base.rescue_from :all do |error|
    Appsignal.set_error(error)
    error!({ :foo => "bar" }.to_json, 500)
  end
end
```

## Example app

We have an [example application][example-app] in our examples repository on
GitHub. The example shows how to set up AppSignal with Grape.
