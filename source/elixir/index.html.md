title: "AppSignal for Elixir"
---

AppSignal supports the [Elixir language][elixir-lang] with a [Elixir
package][appsignal-package]. The package supports pure Elixir applications and
the Phoenix framework out-of-the-box. Other frameworks and packages might
require some [custom instrumentation](/elixir/instrumentation/index.html).

## Installation

To get started with AppSignal for Elixir, follow our guide to [installing
AppSignal](/elixir/installation.html) in your Elixir application for both pure
Elixir and Phoenix installations.

## Integrations

The AppSignal Elixir package also integrates with the Phoenix framework. See
our [Phoenix integration](/elixir/integrations/phoenix.html) page for more
information.

## Configuration

It's possible to configure the AppSignal Elixir package using an initializer or
using environment variables. Read more about [configuring
AppSignal](/elixir/configuration/index.html).

## Instrumentation

To make your own integrations with AppSignal or to add custom instrumentation
to your application, see the
[instrumentation](/elixir/instrumentation/index.html) documentation.
